# Configs for handheld transceivers made using CHIRP

[Here's a good guide on how to use CHIRP](http://www.miklor.com/COM/UV_CHIRP.php) to program your radios.

Included are both the default setup and PMR446 for Baofeng BF-888(S) as well as my own setup which should work at least on UV5R and BF-F8+ handheld transceivers and will most likely work with other UV5R variants as well. 

Please check the guide before proceeding to blindly push these on your radio as I'll take no responsibility if you brick your radios doing that.
